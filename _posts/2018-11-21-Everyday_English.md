* invigorate: 鼓舞的，活跃的，这里意为浓厚的

One of the many good things I have experienced since I moved to China has been an invigorated interest in reading.

* Chinese diaspora: 中国侨民，这里指华侨作家

Since I was eager to learn all about my new home, I turned to Chinese authors as well as foreign authors, including those of the Chinese diaspora.

* revolutionary: 革命的，革命家

I had read a biography of early revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen when I was about 12, long before I ever imagined living here.

* take the name of: 取...名字

One of my early favorites when I arrived in China was US writer and journalist Peter Hessler, who took the name of 何伟 (He Wei) in China.

* primer: 入门书
* newcomer: 新来者，新人

His River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze, about his introduction to China in 1996 as an English teacher in Fuling, Sichuan province — now part of Chongqing — is an excellent primer for newcomers.

* day-to-day：日复一日
* insightful: 见地，意为见地深刻

His descriptions of day-to-day life are insightful, and he captures an interesting point in time as China opened up.

* devour: 吞食，这里意为阅读

I devoured two other well-known Hessler books about China, Oracle Bones and Country Driving.

* sorghum: 高粱

I also read Mo Yan's Red Sorghum, winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature, Edgar Snow's Red Star Over China, novels by Pearl S. Buck and Amy Tan and many more.

* cholera: 霍乱

I am now reading Love in the Time of Cholera by Colombian Nobel Prizewinner Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who was a master of magical realism.

* blue-blood: 贵族，贵族血统
* lose oneself in affairs: 这里指在婚外情中迷失自我，沉迷于婚外情

The woman, Fermina Daza, goes on to marry a blue-blood doctor, while the man, Florentino Ariza, tries to lose himself in affairs while pining away for her for 50 years.

* flowery：华丽的
* ever after: 从此以后

But it is far from a flowery romance novel, and incorporates death, the meaning of life and how "happily ever after" is never so simple.

* insular: 岛，这里指孤立的
* stratified：分层的
* crumbling：摇摇欲坠的，崩溃的

His depictions of an insular, stratified society in a crumbling colonial city being dragged into the modern age are vivid.

* revolve：围绕
* uprising：起义，暴乱，反叛，升起等
* messianic: 救世主
* cult: 礼拜，崇拜

His War of the End of the World revolves around an uprising in 19th century Brazil motivated by a messianic cult.

* portray: 描写，写真

Death in the Andes portrays the gritty reality of Andean towns caught amid the Shining Path terror of the late 20th century.

* cowardice: 怯懦
* penetrating: 透彻，入木三分，这里意为笼罩着
* humidity：雾气，湿气

The Feast of the Goat is a masterful story of the Trujillo years in the Dominican Republic, complete with courage, cowardice and cruelty and set in the penetrating humidity of the Caribbean country.

* foreswear：舍弃，放弃

My wife and I have not totally foresworn the screen — Beijing has some very nice movie theaters, and we enjoy videos on DVD and Youku.com.

* conjure: 想象，变戏法，这里意为通过想象传达

But movies usually pale beside the pictures that master writers can conjure in your head.

* preserve: 保护

As Garcia Marquez once said, "The duty of the writers is not to preserve the language but to open the way for it in history."
