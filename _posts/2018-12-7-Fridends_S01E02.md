* opening act: 开场
* stand-up: 直立的，演变为“直立表演的”，如单口相声，搞笑表演等

I think for us, kissing is pretty muck like an opening act, I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

* He's out banging other women over: 他出去和别的女人胡搞，bang没有找到乱搞的含义
* mastodon: 乳齿象

He's out banging other women over the head with a club while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet.
