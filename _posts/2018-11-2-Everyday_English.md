* colleague: 同事
* dam: 大坝
* entrepreneur: 企业家

My China Daily colleague, Xiao Xiangyi, and I have been able see some of the dams, farms, and industrial parks being built by Chinese companies and entrepreneurs.

* a Roman Catholic priest: 一个天主教神父
* mass: 弥撒，不只有大量、聚焦的含义

As I got closer, I could see that a Roman Catholic priest was holding an open-air mass, as lines of people waited for communion.

* bishop: 主教
* priest: 牧师

We met the ladies of the village gathered together preparing food for a festival and visit by the local bishop, scheduled for the next day. We were invited to have lunch with the priest.

* procession: 队伍，队列
* burial place: 墓地
* much loved: 深受爱戴的

After the service, the whole village joined in procession through some woods and fields to the burial place of the obviously much loved and respected elder.

* source of clean water：清洁水源

It does not even have a well or a reliable nearby source of clean water.

* air-conditioning：空调
* discriminate: 歧视

When I was a young child, few people had air-conditioning, TV was black & white with two channels, and, of course, computers were unheard of. Black people were discriminated against in horrible ways at that time.

* deteriorate：恶化，变坏

But, in other ways, the culture has deteriorated.  

* deadbeat: 游手好闲的人，赖帐不还的人，落魄的人

Ugandan culture is far from perfect. I'm told that there is a lot of violence and high rates of deadbeat fathers.
