* Sustainable Development Goals: SDG
* United Nations: 联合国
* tantalizing: 诱人的，旖旎的
* malaria: 疟疾
* diarrhea：腹泻

We are living in a world that is tantalizingly close to ensuring that no one need die of hunger or malaria or diarrhea.

* spectacularly：壮观的，这里取非常的含义

The SDGs are of course spectacularly complicated.

* fundamentally：从根本上，基本上

Now, the Social Progress Index doesn't look like the SDGs, but fundamentally, it's measuring the same concepts, and the Social Progress Index has the advantage that we have the data.

* indicator: 指示器

We have 51 indicators drawn from trusted sources to measure these concepts.

* caveat: 警告

Now, one caveat.

* get there or thereabouts: 到达那里或附近

And we find that Germany and Japan will get there or thereabouts.

* fall short：不足

But Canada, France, the UK and Italy are all going to fall short.

* nutrition: 营养

Let's start with the good news, and I want to talk about what we call nutrition and basic medical care.

* maternal: 母亲的
* mortality: 死亡率

This covers SDG 2 on no hunger and the basic elements of SDG 3 on health, so maternal and child mortality, infectious diseases, etc.

* sanitation: 卫生，预防

But there's another very basic area of the SDGs where we're doing less well, which is SDG 6, on water and sanitation.

* mobilize: 动员
* galvanize: 激发

If we can focus our efforts, mobilize resources, galvanize the political will, that step change is possible.
