As a algorithm engineer, I've heard Transformer for years, and even learned it several times, but never had a chance to use it.

This blog is also a blog of learning transformer, as I find a blog introducing transformer very well.

Transformer is so famous that I don't need to introduce it anymore, here are some materials to learn it:

1. [Transformer Code by Hardvard](https://nlp-seas-harvard-edu.translate.goog/2018/04/03/attention.html?_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=zh-CN&_x_tr_hl=zh-CN&_x_tr_pto=op)
2. [Attention is all you need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)
3. [Transformer learning blog: This post is all you need](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/420820453?utm_source=wechat_session&utm_medium=social&utm_oi=43416306057216)

And when we need to do a classification or regression task, we can just use TransformerEncoder as model rather than the whole model.
