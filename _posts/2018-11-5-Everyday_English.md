* Mandarin: 普通话，中国官话; 同义词: Putonghua

Most Americans who encountered the blonde-haired, blue-eyed boy during his recent summer vacation in the rural United States figured he was babbling rather than attempting to converse with them in Mandarin.

* presume: 以为，假设，假定，料想

Strangers in northern Michigan would hear me responding to Sagan and at least sometimes presumed we were foreign.

* look the part: 看起来像
* to say the least: 退一步讲

But they were seemingly left guessing at what language we were using, since, when it comes to Chinese, we don’t look the part, to say the least.

* Their faces settled into nods：他们点点头
* affirmation：肯定

Their faces settled into nods, seemingly as much as an affirmation to themselves as to us.

* woodsy：森林，森林的

Otherwise, it really wouldn’t make much sense in the woodsy communities we were visiting.

* mostly separately：断断续续的，零零碎碎的

After two months in the US, including a birthday, Sagan returned to Beijing speaking English, mostly separately. 

* tug：拖，拽
* sleeve：袖子

Still, days after we were reunited, he tugged my sleeve, pointed to the sky and declared: “Baba (Dad!), hai you yi ge (there’s another) airplane flying. Look!”

* unglue：区分，脱胶

His 7-year-old sister, Lily, also learned Chinese first and then mixed until she, also around 3, unglued the languages, both of which she speaks like a native. 

* deficiency：不足，缺陷
* growl: 怒吠，这里应该是取了连续不断，追加的意思
* unfurl：撑，扩展，这里是说将章节扩展一个“儿”化间
* syllable：音节

The only deficiency in her Putonghua (standardized spoken Mandarin) is a Beijing accent in which growling er sounds unfurl the end of many syllables.

* circumnavigate：环航，这里意为绕开
* antipodean：外语；（antipodal: 相反的）

Our family has made it a point to circumnavigate a regret many immigrant families in the US, including Chinese friends, 
repeated to us about raising their kids abroad — that is, allowing the parents’ native tongue to become antipodean.

* sprinkle：夹杂
* overwhelmingly：大量的，压倒性的

My wife, daughter and I sprinkle commonly used Chinese words into overwhelmingly English sentences at home.

* tykes: 小孩子
* annunciate：发音
* consonant：辅音

That’s because tykes who are just starting to talk initially can’t annunciate consonant sounds at the end of syllables。

* nascent: 初期的
* chatterbox: 话多的，这里意为牙牙学语的

So, “horse” is nearly impossible for a nascent chatterbox to pronounce. 

* pesky：麻烦的

* acquisition：获取，习得

But environment’s role in language acquisition recently became clearer as our daughter completed her first month of first grade in a local school.

* haulage: 拖拽，拖运
* substantial: 大量的，实质的
* downtime: 停工期，停机
* nominal: 名义上的，有名无实的
* appropriate: 适当的
* pit: 矿井，陷阱，深坑
* deliberately: 故意的
* fatigue: 疲劳，疲乏
* rear-view mirror: 后视镜（汽车的）
* excavation: 挖掘，发掘
* veer: 转向
* open-cut: 露天的
* conservation: 保护，保持
* correspondence: 通信，一致，相当
* quarry: 采石场，沙石场
* hazardous: 危险的，冒险的，碰运气的
* swerve: 转弯，突然转向，背离
* eliminate: 消除，排除
