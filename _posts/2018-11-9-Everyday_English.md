* routinely: 常规
* consulte: 咨询

Our society routinely makes decisions without consulting a quarter of the population.

* podium: 讲台
* city council chamber: 市议会会议厅

Rarely do you consider the voices of a group of four-year-olds, barely tall enough to reach the podium at city council chambers.

* initiative: 倡议

Back in 2009, I was introduced to a small group of people who wanted to start a child-friendly city initiative in Boulder, Colorado.

* advocate: 主张

I come from a family of civil rights advocates, and I had spent my career until that point working with low-income children and families.

* skeptical: 怀疑的

Now, I bet you're skeptical about this idea.

* affordable housing crisis: 经济适用房危机
* transportation master plan: 总结运输规划

How could children possibly understand complex ideas such as the affordable housing crisis or how to develop a transportation master plan?

* water cannon：水炮
* unsuspecting kayaker：不知情的皮滑艇运动员

Or a bridge with water cannons that fire water onto unsuspecting kayakers below?

* legitimate: 合法

While these concerns sound legitimate, I realized that not including children in city planning was a bigger design problem.

* creek: 溪
* inevitable：无可避免的
* flash flood: 暴涨的洪水

The space needed a new design to better handle the creek's inevitable flash floods, restore a sense of safety to the area and support an expanded farmers' market.

* tubing down the creek: 沿着小溪流下来

Through green picture frames, students highlighted what they liked about the space, such as college students, tubing down the creek.

* inspiration：灵感
* synthesize: 合成

Then, we invited the kids to combine their original ideas with their new inspiration, to synthesize solutions to improve the space.

* block: 街区
* stuffed animal: 毛绒玩具

Boulder's senior urban planners stepped over blocks and stuffed animals to explore preschool students' full-size classroom recreation of the Civic Area.

* marvel: 惊讶
* jelly: 果冻
* bracelet: 手镯

Adult planners marveled at the students' ideas as they shared a park constructed out of a jelly bracelet.

* stroll: 漫步

And separated biking and walking paths, so speeding bikers won't hit young people as they stroll by the creek.

* skydiving: 跳伞
* hang gliding: 悬挂式滑翔
* trampoline: 蹦床
* foam: 泡沫

When we worked with middle-school students to design teen-friendly parks, they drew pictures of skydiving, hang gliding, and jumping from trampolines into giant foam pits.
