* car sick: 晕车

Being car sick is one of my early childhood memories.

* sticky: 黏的
* vinyl: 乙烯基
* nauseous: 恶心
* regularly: 经常

The combination of movement, heat and the chemical smell of sticky vinyl seats in 1960s automobiles regularly caused me to become nauseous as a young boy.

* queasiness：恶心
* motion: 运动
* motion sickness: 晕车

Things got better when I finally was tall enough to look straight out the front window to avoid most of queasiness brought on by motion sickness.

* antique: 古董，过去的，古代的
* rub off: 擦掉，这里意为影响的意思

My grandfather's love of antique automobiles had rubbed off a little.

* interminable: 没完没了
* angst：焦虑

Being stuck in interminable traffic jams and feeling pain of huge car repair bills took the place of car sickness in my album of automobile angst.

* compact: 紧凑的，小的，简洁的

As a boy, I remember my mother, in her compact but heavy steel-bodied Plymouth Valiant, colliding with a little sports car with a Fiber glass body.
