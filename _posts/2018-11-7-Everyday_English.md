**Warning**: 今天的有点儿鸡汤！

take a shot: 投篮

Imagine if Michael Jordan was scared of missing. He would have never taken a shot.

You're gonna have to pick today and I'll tell you one thing, one is a failure and one is success, and if you love success there is nothing that can stop you, all those negative things people say will mean nothing.

Failure isn't permanent,Falling isn't permanent.

That's how winner does it.

不太方便找到原文，今天就这样。
