* virus: 病毒，细菌
* antibiotic: 抗生素

* devastate: 破坏，摧残，蹂躏

It's true, some of them cause devastating disease.

* phages: 噬菌体

Now, the first time I heard about phages was back in 2013.

* surgery: 外科手术，手术
* over the course of：在整个过程中
* chronic: 慢性的，长期的
* bacterial: 细菌

The woman had a knee injury, required multiple surgeries, and over the course of these, developed a chronic bacterial infection in her leg.

* amputate: 截肢

So at this point, typically, the only option left is to amputate the leg to stop the infection from spreading further.

* desperate: 绝望的，这里意味着急需的
* last-resort: 最后一招

Now, my father-in-law was desperate for a different kind of solution, and he applied for an experimental, last-resort treatment using phages.

* electron microscope: 电子显微镜

The image that you see here was taken by an electron microscope.

* grainy: 颗粒感
* prototypical：原型

The grainy thing in the middle with the head, the long body and a number of feet -- this is the image of a prototypical phage.

* bacteria: 菌

And phages are great at infecting bacteria.

* hot bed: 温床
* hunting ground: 狩猎场

And your hand, just like so much of our body, is a hotbed of bacterial activity, making it an ideal hunting ground for phages.

* bacterium：细菌
* aureus：金黄色葡萄球菌
* drug-resistant：抗药性

So in this rendering here, the phage that you see hunts for a bacterium called Staphylococcus aureus, which is known as MRSA in its drug-resistant form. It causes skin or wound infections.

* receptor: 感受器
* on the lookout for：在寻找

The feet are actually extremely sensitive receptors, on the lookout for the right surface on a bacterial cell.

* latch：锁上，闩

Once it finds it, the phage will latch on to the bacterial cell wall and then inject its DNA.

* protein: 蛋白质

Once around 50-100 phages have accumulated within the bacteria cell, the phages are then able to release a protein that disrupts the bacteria cell wall.

* tandem：前后直排的，这里意思为：串联，一起存在的意思

They have always existed in tandem, keeping each other in check.

* abundant: 大量的
* organism: 有机体

Some scientists have even estimated that phages are the most abundant organism on our planet.

* bacillary dysentery：细菌性痢疾
* bacillary: 杆菌
* dysentery：痢疾
* severe: 严重的
* diarrhea: 腹泻

He was interested in a disease called bacillary dysentery, which is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea, and back then, was actually killing a lot of people, because after all, no cure for bacterial infections had been invented.

* cultivate: 培育

He took the sample, filtered it until he was sure that only something very small could have remained, and then took a tiny drop and added it to freshly cultivated bacteria.

* sufficient：足够

The other one: it had to be biologic in nature, because a tiny drop was sufficient to have a huge impact.

* albeit: 尽管，虽然
