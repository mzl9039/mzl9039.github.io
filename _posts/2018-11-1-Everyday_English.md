on an accelerated basis：加速发展
year-on-year：去年同期，同比

The trend is taking place on an accelerated basis in China, as most tech transformations do. The China Internet Network Information Center reported the country had 527 million mobile payment users in December 2017, up 12.3 percent year-on-year.

frustrating: 泄气的，令人沮丧的

Being on holiday often means the frustrating return to counting out unfamiliar notes and coins in colors and sizes that seem ridiculous to the inexperienced - but not for vacationing Chinese.

department stores: 百货商店

The logo of Alipay, Alibaba's virtual wallet app, was proudly displayed on a wide variety of checkouts: cosmetics stores, cafes, department stores. 

bulky: 笨重的
fumble: 摸索

No need for a bulky wallet, and no embarrassed fumbling with cash, marking you as an outsider。

falter：衰退
futy free store: 免税商店

However, the system seems to falter at airport duty free stores unless you have a Chinese ID.
