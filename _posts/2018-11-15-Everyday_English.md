* boast: 夸，自夸

So, I don't like to boast, but I am very good at finding things to be annoyed about.

* compliment：赞扬，称赞
* insult：侮辱

It is a real specialty of mine. I can hear 100 compliments and a single insult, and what do I remember?

* predator: 捕食者

Now, this might have been helpful when we were cave people, trying to avoid predators, but now it's a terrible way to go through life. 

* gratitude: 感谢，谢意

So how can we fight the brain's negative bias? According to a lot of research, one of the best weapons is gratitude.

* agnostic: 不可知的, 这里意为无神论

I'm agnostic, so instead of thanking God, I would thank some of the people who helped make my food a reality.

* quest: 寻求，探索，追逐

Go on quests.

* pave: 铺平

So I would thank the people who paved the road.

* asphalt: 沥青

And then I would thank the people who made the asphalt for the pavement.

* astounding: 惊人

And it reminded me of the astounding interconnectedness or our world.

The power of our actions to change our mind is astounding. 

* barista：咖啡师

I started my trail of gratitude by thanking the barista at my local coffee shop, Joe Coffee in New York.

* upbeat: 乐观的
* enthusiastic hugger: 热情的拥抱

Her name is Chung, and Chung is one of the most upbeat people you will ever meet. Big smiler, enthusiastic hugger.

* vending: 自动售货机

They treat her like a vending machine.

* fertilizer: 肥料

Alright, second lesson was: smell the roses. And the dirt. And the fertilizer.

* pro: 专业，professional 的缩写
* ritual: 仪式

And in return, Ed showed me how to taste coffee like a pro. And it is quite a ritual.

* slurp: 嘟嘟地喝

You take your spoon and you dip it in the coffee and then you take a big, loud slurp. Almost cartoonishly loud.

* spray：喷，喷洒，喷出

This is because you want to spray the coffee all over your mouth.

* honey-crisp: 蜜脆
* maple syrup: 枫树糖浆

This coffee tastes of honey-crisp apple and notes of soil and maple syrup.

We're all busy, but I could spare five seconds, and really think about the texture and the acidity and the sweetness.

* lid: 盖

Now, one of my favorite conversations during this year was with the guy who invented my coffee cup lid.

* aroma：香气

That it can block the aroma, which is so important to the experience.

* hexagon: 六边形

So he designed this lid that's got an upside-down hexagon so you can get your nose right in there and get maximum aroma.

* frenzy: 发疯

Number four is: fake it till you feel it. By the end of the project, I was just in a thanking frenzy.

* grumpiness: 坏脾气

Because I would wake up every morning in my default mood, which is grumpiness, but I would force myself to write a thank-you note and then another and then another.
